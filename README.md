### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install transformers
   ```
Since distil gpt2 is used here, which is a transformer, so to get use of distil gpt2, transformers are required for the pipeline
The main function of distil gpt2 is that when the canddate responses with the language, tech stack, etc, it takes that as input and responses with pre written prompt for that particular stack.<br>
The questions were predefined for personal information of any candidate and the tech stack questions were generated by the distil gpt 2 transformer
2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
3. Challenges faced:
   Using openai api at first since its not open source so it was a problem and for the gemini too the responses were unable to get genrated
